A deployed version of the SB Assessment project is available on Vercel at [social-b](https://social-b.vercel.app/).

Note: Although the main functionalities are there, I didn't have the time to completely finish this project unfortunately. Here's a list of things I would have prioritized if I'd had more time:

- Implement testing with Jest, RTL and Cypress
- Better handling of loading (skeletons - loading spinners) / error / not-found state
- Improve UX by adding transitions/animations on interactive elements
- Fix little bugs / clean my code

Thanks in advance for your feedback!
